You can install on ArchLinux from AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/awesome-keychains-git/


=============
Basic usage
=============

First you should load "keychains" module:

require("keychains")

You should initialize:

keychains.init(globalkeys,your_options_see_docs)

You don't need call 'root.keys(globalkeys)', keychains.init does.

After init you can add your keychains:

    keychains.add({winkey},"c","Web pages","/icons/chromium.png",{
        g   =   {
            func    =   function()
                open_url("https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/l%3Aunread")
            end,
            info    =   "Gmail - unread emails"
        },
        a   =   {
            func    =   function()
                open_url("http://awesome.naquadah.org/")
            end,
            info    =   "awesome web page"
        },
        w   =   {
            func    =   function()
                open_url("http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Main_Page")
            end,
            info    =   "awesome wiki"
        }
    })

With this: if you press 'winkey+c', a notify will popup and you can press
    'g' to open your gmail
    'a' to open awesome web page
    'w' to open awesome wiki

After you've ended to insert your keychains you'll need run:

    keychains.start(5)

The parameter '5' means that if you press 'winkey+c' and don't press anything,
after 5 seconds keychain will exit. This parameter is optional, if the value
is non-set or 0, no timeout.

The keychains table can be a function which generates similar table as above.
